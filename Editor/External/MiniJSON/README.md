MiniJSON.cs
===
A proper git repo for MiniJSON.cs by darktable (https://gist.github.com/darktable/1411710).

I've created this because I started to use MiniJSON.cs for my Unity project. However, I have to copy-paste all the changes people made in the comments to get all the fixes. It was a PITA. I think given a lot of people are using this library, it should be properly managed as a repo so the others can submit pull requests to improve the library.

I'm happy to hand this repo back to @darktable whenever he wants to administrate it.
